# Burt Programming
A place designated to sharing, collaborating on, and saving code for the Blackfish Underwater Robotics Team at the Port Townsend Highschool.

## Using BurtLib_2024
To use the library containing almost all of our code, you must copy the entire `BurtLib_2024` folder you downloaded into your `Arduino/libraries/` folder!! It will not work any other way to my knowledge. If you have made it work a different way, please let me know!

## Progress
**Todo**
- Send data between Arduinos
- Send correct data
- Send data over long distance using chip thing

- Implement motor limiting

- Write doc on how to use BurtLib_2024

**Doing**
- Add proper controller deadbands and tollerances

**Finished**
- Tollerances actually work now
- BONUS! Controller works without batteries now (hoping it fixes various connection issues)
- Get BurtLib_2024 working right
- Get controller working with library system
