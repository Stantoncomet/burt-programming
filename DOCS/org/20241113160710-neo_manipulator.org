* Servo
** Idea
Use a waterproof servo with some type of mechanism that converts rotational motion to linear motion.
** Variations
*** Use a rack and pinion mechanism
In this design the pinion would be connected to a high-torque servo with 180, 360, or continuous motion.
**** Pros
- Simple
- Compact
- Realistic to print with MDF
- Semi-precise control of the arm's position
**** Cons
- Requires proper lubrication
- Can be slower then other linear motion mechanisms
- Mechanical complexity may increase with higher torque or larger rack
- Requires careful calibration
*** Use a worm screw mechanism
In this design, a worm screw drives a nut that moves linearly. The worm screw can also prevent backdrive, solving the issue of stripping out servos and destroying the arm.
**** Pros
- High torque transmission
- Can prevent backdriving, ensuring the arm holds its position
- Self-locking possible
- Suitable for high-load
**** Cons
- More complex design
- Requires lubrication
- Can still be slower compared to other linear motion mechanisms
- Lower efficiency than lead screws
*** Use a lead screw mechanism
In this design, a lead screw and nut convert rotational motion to linear motion with reduced friction compared to worm screws.
**** Pros
- High efficiency
- Can be faster than other linear motion mechanisms
- High accuracy
- Simplicity in between *rack and pinion* and *worm screw*
**** Cons
- May backdrive
- Requires careful calibration
- May wear over time
*** Use a cable driven mechanism
In this design, a servo or other motor is used to drive a cable that pulls the arm along a linear path.
****  Pros
- Lightweight
- Compact
- Flexible
**** Cons
- Wear over time
- Limited strength
- Potentially more complex
- Maintenance
  + Regular maintenance and tension adjustment are required to keep the system functional
* Hydraulics
** Idea
Use hydraulic fluid to actuate a piston or cylinder that moves the arm linearly. Hydraulic systems can provide powerful force with relatively small actuators.
*** *Pros*
- High power-to-weight ratio
- Precise and smooth control
- Compact
*** Cons
- Complexity
  + Requires pumps, reservoirs, and hoses
- Leakage risk
  + Requires sealing
  + A leak would be catastrophic in competition
- Weight
  + Due to the high complexity the multitude of parts might put us into the next weight class
* Electrical Linear Actuators
** Idea
Use an electrical linear actuator to drive the arm mechanism directly.
*** Pros
- Compact
- Precise control
- Simpler to program directly
- No fluid required
  + Unlike hydraulics or pneumatics, electric actuators don't need fluids that means less complexity and no fear of leaks
*** Cons
- Limited force
- Speed
  + Not a very big issue
- Wear and tear
  + Breakage is a possibility but less likely compared to fluid-based systems
* DC Motor
** Idea
Use a DC motor with a gear mechanism (e.g., lead screw, rack and pinion, or belt system) to convert rotary motion into linear motion.
*** Pros
- Compact
- Efficient
- Relatively cheap
*** Cons
- Backdriving
  + A brake would need to be implemented
- Imprecise
- Limited power
*** Note
All of the same pros and cons from the section on servo mechanisms apply
* Pneumatics
** Idea
Use compressed air to actuate a piston or cylinder for linear motion. Pneumatic actuators are lighter than hydraulic systems and can be more responsive.
*** Pros
- Lightweight
  + Lighter than hydraulic
- Fast response
  + Not as important as strength
- Simplicity
  + Compared to hydraulics
*** Cons
- Limited power
  + Weaker than hydraulics
  + Still pretty strong
- Requires pressurized air
  + Compressed air tanks or a compressor are required
  + This adds complexity and weight
- Risk of Leakage
  + Similar to hydraulics, a leak would be catastrophic
